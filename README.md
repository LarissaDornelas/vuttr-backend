## How To Run

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/LarissaDornelas/vuttr-backend

# Go into the repository
$ cd vuttr-backend

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

You'll need an MongoDB instance for running the project. You can use MongoAtlas, Docker or whatever you prefer.

Here are some usefull tutorials for helping you on this process:
